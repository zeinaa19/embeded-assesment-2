Test Case 1:Initialization of the System and the LCD Display
    [Documentation]    [Make sure the system starts up properly and that the LCD shows the default settings and values.]
    
    [Setup steps]
    Power on the system
    Ensure that ADC and LCD components are connected
    Set the temperature sensor to a known temperature

    [Action steps]
    Allow the system to initialize

    [Assertion steps]
    Verify the initial temperature reading on the LCD
    Verify that both the lower and higher limits are set to zero
    Verify the LCD displays "Nok" if temperature is outside the limits

Test Case 2: [Adjust the Lower Limit by Pressing the Button]
    [Documentation]    [Ensure that the value on the LCD is updated accurately by pressing the button designated to raise the lower limit]
    
    [Setup steps]
    Confirm that the LCD is showing the system's temperature
    Ensure the lower limit is initially set to 0

    [Action steps]
    Continuously press the the lower limit button 
    
    [Assertion steps]
    Verify that the LCD's lower limit increases by 5 with each press 
    Verify that the temperature display and higher limit don't change unexpectedly


Test Case 3: [Adjust Upper Limit with Button Press]
    [Documentation]    [ensure that the value on the LCD is updated accurately by pressing the button designated to raise the upper limit]
    
    [Setup steps]
    Confirm that the LCD is showing the system's temperature
    Set the initial upper limit to 0

    [Action steps]
    Press the button for the upper limit incrementally

    [Assertion steps]
    Verify that the LCD's upper limit increases by 5 with each press 
    Confirm that the lower limit and temperature display remain unchanged


Test Case 4: [Display "OK" when Temperature is Within Range]
    [Documentation]    [Confirm that when the current temperature is between the lower and upper limits, the LCD displays "OK," and the correct LED is turned on]
    
    [Setup steps]
    Set lower limit to 20 and upper limit to 30
    Set the sensor to a temperature within this range 
    
    [Action steps]
    Allow the sensor to read the temperature and display it

    [Assertion steps]
    Verify that the LCD displays "OK" in the designated location
    Verify that the right LED, which indicates that the temperature is within range, is activated
    Ensure that the "out-of-range" LED is off

    
    Test Case 5: [Display "Nok" when Temperature is Outside Range]
    [Documentation]    [Ensure that the LCD shows "Nok" and the correct LED turns when the current temperature is below the designated range]
    
    [Setup steps]
    Set lower limit to 10 and upper limit to 20
    Set the sensor to a temperature outside this range 

    [Action steps]
    Allow the sensor to read the temperature and display it
    

    [Assertion steps]
    Verify that "Nok" appears on the LCD in the designated location
    Ensure that the "out-of-range" LED is turned on
    Make sure that the "within-range" LED is off


    Test Case 6: [Constant Temperature Change Monitoring]
    [Documentation]    [Verify that the LCD and LEDs are updated in an instant by the system as temperatures change]
    
    [Setup steps]
    Set lower limit to 15 and upper limit to 25
    Start with a temperature within the range 

    [Action steps]
    Gradually adjust the temperature sensor from within the range (20C) to below the lower limit (10C) and above the upper limit (30C)

    [Assertion steps]
    The "out-of-range" LED turns on and the LCD changes from "OK" to "Nok" as the temperature drops below the lower limit
    The LCD shows "Nok" and the "out-of-range" LED stays on when the temperature rises above the upper limit
    The "within-range" LED should be on and the LCD should read "OK" when it is inside the limit


    Test Case 7: [LCD Display Accuracy]
    [Documentation]    [Ensure that, even at boundary values, the LCD accurately shows the temperature as well as both the upper and lower limits]
    
    [Setup steps]
    Set the lower and upper limits to the minimum and maximum possible values
    
    [Action steps]
    Display various temperature readings

    [Assertion steps]
    Verify that the LCD shows the temperature, lower and upper limits correctly and without any format or truncation problems
    Confirm that boundary temperatures accurately display "OK" or "Nok" along with the relevant LED status
